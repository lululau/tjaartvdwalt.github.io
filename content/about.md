My name is *Tjaart van der Walt*. The name *Tjaart*[^1] is originally Dutch[^2].

It is a shortened version of the German name *Diethard* which translates to: *The strong one of the people*

Today most *Tjaart*s are likely to be South African[^3].

You pronounce it like [this](http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/tjaart).

My last name *van der Walt* is Dutch as well. It means *from the Wood*.
