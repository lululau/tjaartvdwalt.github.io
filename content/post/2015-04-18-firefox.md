# The problem

I have been struggling with speed issues with Firefox on Linux for a long time.

Firefox forms a central part of my browsing workflow because I use [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/) to save my passwords, and the [passff](https://github.com/jvenant/passff#readme) Firefox plugin to fill forms. To my knowledge there is no plugin for Chrome compatible with pass. (I previously used `Keepass`, but I did not like the fact that it is really a Windows app ported for Linux, and that it ties you to its gui interface. Pass does things the Unix way, and I like that.)

I always had the suspicion that my speed issues were due to the fact that my Flash plugin was grossly out of date. (If you are a Linux user you will probably know that Adobe stopped supporting the Flash plugin for Linux a few years ago.)

For Linux users the only way to have an up to date Flash plugin is to use the `Pepperflash plugin` that ships with Google Chrome. The Firefox developers however do not want to [adopt this approach](http://www.internetnews.com/blog/skerner/mozilla-doesnt-want-pepper-for-linux-flash.html).

# The solution

A couple of days ago my browser was incredibly slow once again and I began to look around for a way to use Pepperflash with Firefox, and I found [freshplayerplugin](https://github.com/i-rinat/freshplayerplugin).

On Arch Linux it was super simple to install it from the AUR:

    yaourt -S freshplayerplugin

I also removed the old Adobe flash plugin:

    yaourt -S flashplugin

2 days in, and my Firefox is feeling much more responsive.
