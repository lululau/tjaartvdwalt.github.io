# Free Sofware

<a href="http://u.fsf.org/16f"><img class="rounded-img float-right" width="220" src="//static.fsf.org/nosvn/images/badges/i-support-fs_red-bg.png" alt="I support free software"></a>

I am an advocate for [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/). 

On a philosophical level I believe that source code should be provided together with  binaries when selling software to a user, and that users should have the right to fix bugs, or to add new features to software they buy or use.

My thoughts on this matter was shaped by endless frustration with proprietary software  packages that did not do what I wanted (thanks Microsoft). Eventually I was converted to Free Software by reading Richard Stallman's book: [Free Software, Free Society](http://www.gnu.org/doc/fsfs-ii-2.pdf). 

I do not agree with some of the Free Software Foundation's negative campaign strategies. I understand that they want to educate people about the perils of proprietary software, but I would personally focus more on the positive influences of Free Software. For me the FSF's most important contribution is giving us [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/). GNU software is an integral part of any Linux/Unix (and even Mac) system, and that is really something to be proud of.
