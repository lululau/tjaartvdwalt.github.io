      <div class="summary">UPDATE 2015-08-26 This method described here is tricky to get working, and I think it could cause problems in future when I have forgotten the details. I have reverted to the standard config of using gpg-agent for gpg-keys, and ssh-agent for ssh-keys. In addition I now use keychain to cache the passwords for both of the agents. This way I have my encrypted private keys, I don&rsquo;t have any non-standard configuration, and I only have to type in my passwords once for each session.</div>

      <div class="summary">What is App Transport Security? ATS is Apple&rsquo;s term for a set of &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; minimum security requirements that must be met in order for a client to establish a connection with a server. ATS is being enforced by default on iOS 9, and OSX 10.11. On Stackoverflow respondents will tell you that ATS = TLS 1.2, but this is only partly true. ATS actually has 3 requirements: The server should support at least TLS 1.2 The server should only support connection ciphers that provide forward secrecy (See the complete list) Certificates needs to be signed with SHA-256, and use at least a 2048-bit RSA key (or 256-bit ECC key) My experience implementing ATS Diagnosing problems Implementing ATS is actually pretty straight forward, but it took me a couple of days to get right.</div>

      <div class="summary">I want to announce the release of version 0.1.1 of my Free Software tool photo_rename. To understand the importance of this release, you need to know some of its back story: The tragedy A couple of years ago, in a comedy of errors, I accidentally deleted my photo albums from my computer. In a further twist, my off-site backup was not working correctly. I did not realize the mistake immediately, so traditional undelete tools could not recover the files, since I had written to the disk since the accident.</div>

I bought a TRRS connector from mycablemart. (see the Problems (See section ) section below) I bought the key caps from signature plastics.

      <div class="summary">The problem I have been struggling with speed issues with Firefox on Linux for a long time. Firefox forms a central part of my browsing workflow because I use pass to save my passwords, and the passff Firefox plugin to fill forms. To my knowledge there is no plugin for Chrome compatible with pass.

On a philosophical level I believe that source code should be provided together with binaries when selling software to a user, and that users should have the right to fix bugs, or to add new features to software they buy or use. My thoughts on this matter was shaped by endless frustration with proprietary software packages that did not do what I wanted (thanks Microsoft).</div>

      <div class="summary">I know that my ideas in this article will be hated by many staunch Org mode supporters. I still believe I am right. For the last few years I have been using the Emacs plugin Org mode. This is an amazing text outliner tool that can do just about anything. As a student I used it to create Latex document, Latex Beamers, project websites etc. Its coolness knows no bounds, you can even create a spreadsheet in plain text!</div>
